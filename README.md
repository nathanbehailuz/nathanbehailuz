# Hello World! 

My name is Nathan, a rising junior at New York University, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Applied Mathematics and Economics. I am currently working as a Big Data research assistant under the guidance of Professor Gabriel-Kohler Derrick at NYU and Jeremy Bowels at University College London. My work involves extracting precolonial Ireland data from 40,000 pages using OCR, followed by post-processing and data analysis.
